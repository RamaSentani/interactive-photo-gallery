# interactive-photo-gallery
## An interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and CSS Grid Layout.
At the top of the page, you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be "back" and "previous" arrows to cycle through photos.
